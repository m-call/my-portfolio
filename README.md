# My Portfolio

A webpage to showcase my coding portfolio to potential employers. The portfolio includes overviews of various projects I've completed with links to their corresponding deployed web applications that I've created.

## Additions and Changes

- Added the first iteration of the header and navigation bar in index.html and added the styling for the header and navigation bar in style.css. Also, added a background color to the entire page in the body element selector in style.css and created two variables for colors in the root selector in style.css for reusability.
- Changed the header and nav bar styling to flex display and tweaked some of the styling properties to better match the mock-up.
- Added a semantic figure element which works from the newly created class top-img to add an image across the top of the page underneath the navigation bar. 
- Created an H2 heading inside of a div element which works from the newly created subtitle class in order to display a small box with a subtitle for the page. The box was styled to appear on the top right side of the page on top of the image under the nav bar.
- Created an about-me class to display the About Me section with styling
- Added the heading and paragraph tags with placeholder information
- Created a parent section with a work class to set up the flex box styling for the big image within the Work section
- Added the heading, image with alt attribute, and a subtitle each with their own classes
- Created the parent section with a other-work class to set up the flex box styling for the 4 smaller images within the Work section
- Added a section for all the images with a row class to style the boxes where the images are held to fit the page
- Added 4 sections each with their own class for each image's subtitle box
- Created the contact-me class and used that in its own section for the Contact Me part of the page
- Added the heading and created another section inside with its own contacts class to style the contact links
