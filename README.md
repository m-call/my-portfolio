# My Portfolio

A webpage to showcase my coding portfolio to potential employers. The portfolio includes overviews of various projects I've completed with links to their corresponding deployed web applications that I've created.

## Additions and Changes

- Created the initial GitHub repo and cloned to my local machine. Then, added the initial index.html file and set up the basis of the HTML file. Also added the style.css and reset.css and set up the basis of each of those with some added comments for clarity and organization. Finally, linked both the reset.css and style.css to the index.html file.
- - Pushed to GitHub
- Added the first iteration of the header and navigation bar in index.html and added the styling for the header and navigation bar in style.css. Also, added a background color to the entire page in the body element selector in style.css and created two variables for colors in the root selector in style.css for reusability.
